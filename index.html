									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Sarah Castle is an assistant professor of mathematics education within the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences Department and is affiliated with the Curriculum and Instruction Department within the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences. She earned her doctorate in mathematics education at Michigan State University in 2023 and her master’s from MSU in mathematics in 2022. Her work is twofold. First, it centers on using computation to uncover manifestations of inequity within undergraduate STEM contexts and working to advance critical investigations of structural systemic inequities. Secondly, she uses computation as an environment for students to engage in mathematical creativity and provide new opportunities for previously marginalized students while also investigating the affordances and constraints of using computing as a mathematical pedagogy. Her most recent project focuses on introducing computational modeling students to linear algebra through a series of modules in Jupyter Notebooks and the relation with mathematical creativity. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, swimming, playing with her cats, and crafting.

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p> At the undergraduate level, I have teaching experience as (1) an instructor of record with full responsibility for teaching the class, grading, writing assessments and assignments, developing interactive computational exercises, etc. (2) private and volunteer tutor (middle school to post-secondary), and (3) teaching assistant for the instructor of record where I graded materials, lead recitations, and held office hours. </p>
